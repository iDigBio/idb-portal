Make the following corrections before use in production:
/public/client/js/lib/dwc_fields.js::
- "dwc:associatedOccurrences" is duplicated and will appear twice in
  specimen record pages.
- Value for $.names.extendedspecimen has an inappropriate value.
/public/client/js/react/src/record.js::
- New fields are given CSS property 'backgroundColor: palegreen'
  for visibility. Find and remove all usages of 'DEMO_BGCOLOR'.
- If not giving 'extendedspecimen' its own section, remove from array
  assigned to `var sorder`
