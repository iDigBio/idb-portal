The [iDigBio specimen portal](https://portal.idigbio.org/portal/search) provides access to millions of records about neontological and paleontological specimens curated at museums and other institutions in the US. 
Records might include information about the specimen, when, where and by whom it was collected, the institution providing the data, images and other media related to the specimen. 
The main intent of this tutorial is to familiarize the user with the search capabilities of this portal.
