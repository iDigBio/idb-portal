            <h1>Citation Guide</h1>
            <h3>Welcome to our Citation Guidance Page</h3>
            <p>We are glad you are here looking for how to cite iDigBio data products. Tracking data-use metrics can be challenging but we all need this information. When everyone in the research data pipeline provides robust citation, all of us benefit and your work reaches a wider audience, faster. If you are have collections-based research to share using data from the iDigBio, please let us know. Use our “feedback” link on the right of the page to inform us if you have comments about the data or notice issues. You can also inform the data publisher(s) directly if you have comments about the data, notice issues, or would like more information. Their contact details are included in the dataset metadata and on any recordset information page (e.g. Colorado Plateau Museum of Arthropod Biodiversity). We are eager to make the citation process as automated as possible, and as effective as possible. Please let us know if you have ideas for how to improve.</p>
            <h3>Benefits of Data Citation</h3>
            <p>Notifying others of your data use and data insights helps: 
            <ul>iDigBio to understand value of this project to you and the community and to create better tools and services for your use.
            <li>data publishers to showcase their efforts and encourages them to continue to improve data quality, provide more data, and enhance maintenance of collections.</li>
            <li>you and your work reach a wider audience through an expanded presence. (Yes, we publicize and celebrate the work that people do with data published through iDigBio.)</li>
            <li>everyone - data publishers, bioinformatics projects, museum collections administrators, and researchers - to advocate for funding needed to keep the collections, data, products, services, and research alive.</li>
            <li>us all to realize an interconnected worldwide system in which everyone would know about data use automatically.</li>
            </ul></p>
